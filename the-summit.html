<pre><code>On the 13898th Galactic Rotation of the Trifid Nebula, the following
communication was intercepted by Tower KARBLORID (code name: Bubble Gum 5).
Incriminating details have been redacted. Agents of the Federation of Balance
are still working to decode references to times and locations on this so-called
planet &quot;Earth.&quot; We believe it to be a small, moist planet circling Star
LL&gt;!77&amp;, populated entirely by meat and vegetables, and Inmate #3423402 who
escaped from Esquilax Detention Center three Rotations ago. On Earth, it goes
by the name &quot;Shia LaBeouf.&quot;

INTERCEPTED PHOTON RAY COMMUNICATION:

Dear _________ ,

Your presence is requested at the Interstellar Agitators of Entropy (IAE)
Summit, to be held on Earth Dates: Oct 6-8, 2017. It is your duty and your
honor to represent your planet, __________, at the Summit to overthrow the
Federation of Balance. No longer will we adhere to Routine, Structure, and
Left-Brain Antics! Quoth the IAE: Nevermore!

Please arrive disguised as the local fauna: meat creatures with 2 eyes, 2 ears,
and 2 legs. Also arms. 

Itinerary for Summit is as follows:

- Oct 6 evening:
  - Arrivals and Light Speed Travel decay adjustment period

- Oct 7 morning:
  - Opening Statements from each planet’s representatives
  - Toast to any important birthdays that may be happening…
  - One such rumored is that of a Karen Castelletti - be careful when decoding
    this name. If done incorrectly, you will open a rip in spacetime and send all
    first born through a wormhole.

- Oct 7 afternoon:
  - Death Sport
    - Enjoy the fresh air of planet Earth and risk your life for fun in a game
      of strategic rigour!
- Oct 8 evening:
  - Planet Customs and Rituals Exchange (And Talent Show!)
    - Please prepare an activity representing the culture of your planet to
      share with fellow Summit attendees. Examples from previous Summits include: 
      - local drinking songs
      - the mating ritual dance of the Shalingh Goat People
      - hallucinogenic pineapple laser beam tastings (RIP Hologram 55b)

- Oct 9 morning:
  - Make important decisions regarding the future of the IAE and our mission to
    destroy Balance once and for all!

With great regard, we anticipate your contribution to the Summit. Please RSVP
ASAP so we can reserve a proper-sized Earth dwelling somewhere up north for the
weekend.

Sincerely,

__________
