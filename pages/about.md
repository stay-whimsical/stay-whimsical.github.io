# About

Stay Whimsical is Karen, Sara, and [Pablo.][1] We're hackers who love magic and
stories and were given the advice to "stay whimsical" by a marker-bearing saint
who visited a barely-functioning [Screamchess][2].

## THINGS WE LIKE

* Art
* That very brief moment as you pick up an empty suitcase that you thought
  was full and feel extremely strong.
* Our creatures: [shouldercat][3], Rocco, and Sapo

## THAT WHICH WE DETEST

* Art
* Status jostling
