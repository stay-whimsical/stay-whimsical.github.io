We're hackers who love magic and stories and were given the advice to "stay
whimsical" by a marker-bearing saint who visited our major first project, a
barely-functioning [Screamchess][2].

We all work full-time as professionals in software of different stripes,
currently situation in the greater New York area.

## THINGS WE LIKE

* Art
* That very brief moment as you pick up an empty suitcase that you thought
  was full and feel extremely strong.
* Our creatures: [shouldercat][3], Rocco, and Sapo

## THAT WHICH WE DETEST

* Art
* Defensive irony
* Status jostling
