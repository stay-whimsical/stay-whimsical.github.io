# Alignment Therapy

**D&D-themed alignment**

April 6, 2018.

---

Kostume Kult's [Horned Ball][1] was themed after tabletop roleplaying
games:

> This year’s annual Horned Bacchanal delves into Fantasy Gaming with a
> twisted take on World of Warcraft, Dungeons & Dragons and the many
> interactive realms that have come from them. A night of wild
> costumery, absurdist activities and magical DJs in two rooms.

> As always, any and all forms of horns are welcome as the winter melts and the
> animals stir. For this year’s theme, be prepared for an evening of fantasy
> themed horned adventure, interactive theater and strange creatures, INCLUDING
> YOU!…  For inspiration, much of this universe springs from Tolkien’s Lord of
> the Rings Trilogy (1937-1949) leading to millions  of fantasy novels and
> films, the D&D table top gaming system, Video RPGs, MMORPGs and LARP… Look
> them up!  So much to choose from!  CRAFT THOSE HORNS!

With this in mind, we set up a booth to help determine or guess your Alignment,
per [D&D tradition][2].

### Original concept

Originally, the idea was to be something like Lucy in _Peanuts_ offering
psychiatric help:

_except_ that you'd roll dice to determine the alignment of your advice. So an
exchange might look like:

> I'm having a lot of trouble communicating with my partner: I think they feel
> challenged by my professional success. We're in the same field, and my career
> is advancing a lot faster than his, even though he's had more years in
> industry. How can I be the best partner to him while he's so hung up on
> wanting to be "the breadwinner"?

If you rolled _Neutral Evil_ dice:

> It's clear and perfectly acceptable that your partner is inferior to you, and
> it's a shame that they can't live with this. The ideal way to resolve
> this would be to sabotage their career: only by crushing them harder will they
> realize your glory, when the semblance of hope of surpassing you is completely
> extinguished.

If you rolled _Chaotic Good_, your therapist might say:

> Your partner is unfortunately fixated on the wrong things; can't he see that
> they system he so seeks approval from is exactly what keeps him and you down?
> Luckily, this gives you options: work with him to redefine your industry such
> that you're both winners. Kick out the incumbants so your own greatness can
> shine through. If that's insurmountable, you can nudge him into better career
> decisions by leaving breadcrumbs, or subverting his tendencies to shoot
> himself in the foot.

### Refinement

Working with event organizers, and keeping in mind that noise may make it hard
to keep a good conversation, we made an interactive intake form, which also
doubled as a way to determine how "game" partygoers would be to participate:

We also provided cards with abstract art on them (from the game [Dixit][3]) and
asked interactive questions to "assign" and/or guess the alignment of
characters. A spread may look like this:

and we'd ask things like

* Which makes you happiest and why?
* Which fills you with dread?
