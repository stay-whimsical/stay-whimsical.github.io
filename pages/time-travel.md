# TIME TRAVEL

**Carouse around NYC to prevent a time paradox!**

March 3, 2018

## Gallavanting around NYC

There's a mad time traveler on the loose, and it's up to a group of Time Justice
Enforcers to stop them! Determine the next stop the time traveler made in
several stops in New York City to prevent the time paradox!

Participants arrived in costume/character from whatever era they wished, and
collectively participated in traversing several neighborhoods in the Greater New
York Area.

## Initial Invite

Dear Time Travelers,

The time warp sensors at the United Paradox Detection Front have been scribbling
off the page. Someone among our ranks is up to no good, fiddling with the time
strings, hop-skipping all over the city forward and back through the centuries.
They’re a bit of a slob though, leaving clues every time they jump. It’s up to
us to follow their tracks, stop their nonsense, and bring them to justice before
they rip a hole in the fabric of space time.

The signature of their first jump out of the present puts them somewhere in
Manhattan, South of Houston. You must go to the place where a man turned a loft
into an inverted coffin, at 2pm, on March 3rd, 1977. You’ll find your fellow
Time Justice Enforcers (TJE) there, but note, the portal closes at 3pm, so do
remember that punctuality is the highest virtue in a TJE. Dress for the occasion
- you won’t want to be recognized, or worse, photographed, as an anachronistic
  parasite (Looking at you, Joel). We recommend you pick an era and stick to the
  fashions of that time. If we get a good enough shuffle of styles, we’ll simply
  be seen as a timeless gaggle of weirdos.

  Chronspede,
  TJE 30
