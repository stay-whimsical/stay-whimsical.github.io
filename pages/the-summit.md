October 6-8, 2017

---

A private weekend event with the premise of an intergalactic peace
summit, participants were invited to come representing the best their planet has
to offer.

### Highlights and Participants

Pablo came as the interpreter for the royal dignitary in his hands (think of
C-3PO):

To activate the various translation modes, it came with [an instruction
manual][1] (PDF).

### Invitation email:

```
On the 13898th Galactic Rotation of the Trifid Nebula, the following
communication was intercepted by Tower KARBLORID (code name: Bubble Gum 5).
Incriminating details have been redacted. Agents of the Federation of Balance
are still working to decode references to times and locations on this so-called
planet "Earth." We believe it to be a small, moist planet circling Star
LL>!77&, populated entirely by meat and vegetables, and Inmate #3423402 who
escaped from Esquilax Detention Center three Rotations ago. On Earth, it goes
by the name "Shia LaBeouf."

INTERCEPTED PHOTON RAY COMMUNICATION:

      of strategic rigour!
