<p><strong>D&amp;D-themed alignment</strong></p>
<p>April 6, 2018.</p>
<p><hr/>Kostume Kult&#39;s <a href='http://www.kostumekult.com/events/hb18/'>Horned Ball</a> was themed after tabletop roleplaying
games:</p>
<blockquote><p>This year’s annual Horned Bacchanal delves into Fantasy Gaming with a
twisted take on World of Warcraft, Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the many
interactive realms that have come from them. A night of wild
costumery, absurdist activities and magical DJs in two rooms.</p>
<p>As always, any and all forms of horns are welcome as the winter melts and the
animals stir. For this year’s theme, be prepared for an evening of fantasy
themed horned adventure, interactive theater and strange creatures, INCLUDING
YOU!…  For inspiration, much of this universe springs from Tolkien’s Lord of
the Rings Trilogy (1937-1949) leading to millions  of fantasy novels and
films, the D&amp;D table top gaming system, Video RPGs, MMORPGs and LARP… Look
them up!  So much to choose from!  CRAFT THOSE HORNS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, we set up a booth to help determine or guess your Alignment,
per <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)'>D&amp;D tradition</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Original-concept">Original concept</h3>

<p>Originally, the idea was to be something like Lucy in <em>Peanuts</em> offering
psychiatric help:</p>
<p><img alt='Lucy providing therapy' src='/img/alignment-therapy/lucy.jpg' /></p>
<p><em>except</em> that you&#39;d roll dice to determine the alignment of your advice. So an
exchange might look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#39;m having a lot of trouble communicating with my partner: I think they feel
challenged by my professional success. We&#39;re in the same field, and my career
is advancing a lot faster than his, even though he&#39;s had more years in
industry. How can I be the best partner to him while he&#39;s so hung up on
wanting to be &quot;the breadwinner&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you rolled <em>Neutral Evil</em> dice:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#39;s clear and perfectly acceptable that your partner is inferior to you, and
it&#39;s a shame that they can&#39;t live with this. The ideal way to resolve
this would be to sabotage their career: only by crushing them harder will they
realize your glory, when the semblance of hope of surpassing you is completely
extinguished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you rolled <em>Chaotic Good</em>, your therapist might say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your partner is unfortunately fixated on the wrong things; can&#39;t he see that
they system he so seeks approval from is exactly what keeps him and you down?
Luckily, this gives you options: work with him to redefine your industry such
that you&#39;re both winners. Kick out the incumbants so your own greatness can
shine through. If that&#39;s insurmountable, you can nudge him into better career
decisions by leaving breadcrumbs, or subverting his tendencies to shoot
himself in the foot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="Refinement">Refinement</h3>

<p>Working with event organizers, and keeping in mind that noise may make it hard
to keep a good conversation, we made an interactive intake form, which also
doubled as a way to determine how &quot;game&quot; partygoers would be to participate:</p>
<p>[placeholder for form]</p>
<p>We also provided cards with abstract art on them (from the game <a href='https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit'>Dixit</a>) and
asked interactive questions to &quot;assign&quot; and/or guess the alignment of
characters. A spread may look like this:</p>
<p>[placeholder for cards]</p>
<p>and we&#39;d ask things like</p>
<ul><li>Which makes you happiest and why?</li><li>Which fills you with dread?</li></ul>
